Yesterday, I wired up my first database. CircleShare could finally *remember* who its users were. But then it hit me... right now, **anyone** can call `/users` and see everyone‚Äôs info.  

That‚Äôs not great for a private app meant to hold personal updates.  

Time to add **security basics**.  


## Authentication vs Authorization  

These are the two concepts that people casually use interchangeably. However, if you know their meaning, they should never be mixed up. They serve very distinct purposes:  
- **Authentication (AuthN)** answers the question:
 *‚ÄúAre you who you say you are?‚Äù*  
  ‚Üí Think of showing your ID at the door.  

- **Authorization (AuthZ)** answers the question: *‚ÄúNow that I know who you are, what are you allowed to do?‚Äù*  
  ‚Üí Think of the bouncer checking if you‚Äôre on the VIP list.  

For CircleShare:  
- Authentication = logging in with your email/password and getting back a token that proves it‚Äôs you.  
- Authorization = using that token to access only the routes you‚Äôre allowed (like your profile, your circle‚Äôs timeline, not someone else‚Äôs).  


## How I Solved It  

### Step 1: Hash Passwords  
I switched from storing plain passwords to **hashed** ones (Argon2). Plain passwords are like writing your ATM PIN on a sticky note. Hashing makes it unreadable gibberish.  

### Step 2: JWT Tokens for Authentication  
When you log in, the API checks your password and then issues a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.  

A JWT is like a digital boarding pass: it says *‚Äúthis person is who they claim to be‚Äù* and has an expiration time. You send it back with every request as proof.  

Minimal example:  

```python
@app.post("/login")
def login(user_credentials: UserLogin, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == user_credentials.email).first()
    if not user or not verify_password(user_credentials.password, user.hashed_password):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")

    token = create_access_token(data={"sub": user.email})
    return {"access_token": token, "token_type": "bearer"}
```

### Step 3: Protected Routes for Authorization  
Once you have a token, you can access protected routes. Without it? You get `401 Unauthorized`.  

Example:  

```python
@app.get("/profile")
def get_profile(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return current_user
```

That one `Depends(get_current_user)` does all the heavy lifting:  
- Reads the token from the header  
- Validates it  
- Loads the user from the database  
- Passes it into your function  

Magic.  

## Seeing It in Action  

1. Register a new user ‚Üí `POST /register`  
2. Log in ‚Üí `POST /login` ‚Üí get back a JWT  
3. Click ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù in the FastAPI docs, paste in your token  
4. Now you can call `/profile` or `/users` successfully  
5. Without a token? You‚Äôre locked out  

That was the first time CircleShare *felt* secure.
