I’ve decided to build an app called **CircleShare**. 

Think of it as a private social journal where you share life updates with your inner circle. That means family *and* close friends: the people you actually want to stay connected with, not the hundreds of acquaintances you barely talk to.  

I’m writing these posts partly to track my own progress, and partly because when I was starting out, I wished there were more “build in public” stories that showed the messy parts. If you’ve ever stared at documentation wondering, **“where the heck do I even start?”**, I want these posts to feel like a guide you can build alongside.  

I’ve been there. Feeling like everyone already knows what an API is, while you’re Googling “what’s the difference between GET and POST?” Fighting off that voice that says *maybe you’re not cut out for this*.  

So here’s my deal: I’ll build CircleShare step by step, share the stumbles as much as the wins, and hopefully show that learning to code is less about being perfect and more about keeping at it.  


## What Is CircleShare?  

We all have our **inner circle**: parents, siblings, cousins, best friends, or even chosen family, the people we’d update no matter what.  

Right now, that’s hard to do. I’m juggling WeChat for my parents, Line for my in-laws, Instagram for a couple of friends, and texts for those who don’t use social media. Every life update feels like three or four repeats.  

And here’s the thing: I’m not into traditional social media. Posting on Instagram feels like broadcasting, like I have to stage a moment big enough to announce. The feeds, the algorithms, the endless scrolling, none of it feels peaceful.  

**What I want instead:**  
- One quiet timeline where I post once, and my circle can all see it — no matter what platform they normally use.  
- A place where updates feel natural, not performative.  
- Something that feels like a **journal**, but shared: I write my milestones, they can comment and react, and together we build a small timeline of life.  

**CircleShare is my solution:**  
- Share life moments **once**, privately, like keeping a journal.  
- Everyone can **comment** and **like**, like social media features, but only the people you invited.  
- No feeds, no noise, no algorithms.  
- A record of your life you can look back on, and your friends/family can do the same.  

It’s not about replacing social media. It’s about offering an alternative for those of us who want to stay close without the noise, or the feeling that we’re performing online.  

On the tech side, CircleShare will be a full-stack project: 
- **FastAPI** for the backend
- **React** for the frontend 
- **Docker** for deployment
- full features, including user authentication, file uploads, notifications, and a timeline-based interface. 

For me, this is a way to learn everything from APIs to Frontend to deployment, while creating something useful for my own life.  

Will it fix social media overwhelm for everyone? Probably not. 

But if it helps me and my people share life updates in a calmer way, that’s already a win. And along the way, I’ll be leveling up as a developer.
