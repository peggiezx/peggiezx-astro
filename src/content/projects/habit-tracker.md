# Tiny-Streak Habit Tracker

An iOS app that gamifies habit building through visual progress tracking and psychology-based timer techniques.

## Overview

Building consistent habits is one of the most challenging aspects of personal development. Tiny-Streak combines proven behavioral psychology with engaging visual feedback to make habit formation feel rewarding and sustainable.

## Key Features

- **Brain-Hack Timers**: Implements scientifically-backed timing strategies like the Pomodoro Technique and micro-commitments
- **Visual Progress**: Watch your virtual house grow as you maintain streaks
- **Offline-First Design**: All data stored locally using Core Data for complete privacy
- **Streak Animations**: Satisfying visual feedback celebrates milestone achievements
- **Habit Stacking**: Build new habits by linking them to existing routines

## Technical Architecture

Built entirely with SwiftUI for modern iOS development patterns. Uses Core Data for robust local storage and CloudKit for optional cross-device sync. The app implements a custom animation system for the house-building progression.

## Behavioral Psychology Integration

The app incorporates several evidence-based techniques:
- **Tiny Habits Method**: Start with 2-minute versions of desired behaviors
- **Implementation Intentions**: Link habits to specific contexts and triggers
- **Streak Visualization**: Leverage loss aversion to maintain consistency
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Gradually increase commitment as habits solidify

## User Experience

The interface prioritizes simplicity and quick interactions. Users can log habit completion with a single tap, and the house-building animation provides immediate positive feedback. The timer feature helps users commit to just enough effort to maintain momentum without overwhelming their schedule.

## Privacy-First Approach

All habit data remains on the user's device by default. Optional iCloud sync is available for users who want cross-device access, but the app functions completely offline for users who prefer maximum privacy.
